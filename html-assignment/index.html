        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            My name is Mikaela, I am a Toronto-born documentary filmmaker currently living in Ottawa, Ontario. I grew up
            in Basel, Switzerland, a small city on the boarder of Switzerland, Germany, and France. In 2015, I returned
            to Canada to finish my last year of high school and prepare for university. I graduated from Concordia
            University's Mel Hoppenheim School of Cinema with a BFA in Film Production, and currently study Interactive
            Media Design at Algonquin College. I have two white cats, and in my spare time I love to play guitar,
            practice landscape and wildlife photography, and tend to my house plants.

            </ul>

            The 1<sup>st</sup> documentary I directed was in 2019, titled <em>Ilana Dances</em>, and was a portrait
            about a single mother of three and how her passion for pole dance affected her home life and that of her
            young daughters. My most recent documentary, <em>Pappy's Garden</em> (2021), is about my grandfather, a
            first generation immigrant to Canada from Jamaica in the 1950s. It won best documentary at <abbr
                title="Concordia Film Festival">CFF</abbr>, and has been screened at international film festivals such
            as Hot Docs 2022 and <abbr title="Rendez-Vous QuÃ©bec Cinema">RVQC</abbr>. It is currently being distributed
            by <abbr title="Canadian Filmmakers Distribution Centre">CFMDC</abbr> in Toronto. As well as documentary
            work, I also produce freelance video and photography projects for a range of clients. Some of my favourite
            landscape and wildlife photographs have been featured on social media pages such as Canadian Geographic and
            <abbr title="Canadian Broadcast Corporation">CBC</abbr>. Though I love video and photography work, I wanted
            to expand my knowledge of digital media and design by attending Algonquin College, which is why I am
            currently studying Interactive Media Design.
